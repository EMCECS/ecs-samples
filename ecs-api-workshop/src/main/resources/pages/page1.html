<h1>This is a sub-page of a static website</h1>
<p>All of the images, stylesheets and links you see are hosted within a bucket and publicly readable.
    Note that all references are relative.  This is because the namespace is included in the host name, which consumes
    the wildcard portion of the SSL certificate.  Therefore the bucket must be in the path, which would mess up any
    absolute references.</p>
